# Gemini CLI Deployment Prompt for New Environment

Create a comprehensive and systematic `DEPLOYMENT.md` file for the project located in the current folder. The focus is on deploying the project **on a new environment using Laragon** on Windows. The instructions must enable someone unfamiliar with the project to confidently deploy and run it without missing any step.

Include the following details:

- Include the current date and time at the beginning of the file.
- Overview and prerequisites for using Laragon (Windows environment).
- Steps to install Laragon if not already installed.
- How to place the project files into Laragonâ€™s `www` folder or equivalent.
- Setting the correct PHP version and any necessary modules/extensions in Laragon.
- Database setup instructions: creating the database, configuring credentials, running migrations and seeders if applicable.
- Environment configuration, such as `.env` file setup or equivalent.
- Installing project dependencies (Composer, npm, etc.) with necessary commands.
- Starting Laragon services, accessing the project via browser with default localhost or custom virtual hosts.
- Troubleshooting common errors or misconfigurations during deployment.
- Suggestions for automating or improving the deployment workflow for future environments.

The generated file should be easy to follow, professionally toned, and richly formatted using headings, bullet lists, and code blocks for commands.

Make sure the deployment instructions are **complete and error-proof** so that the project runs successfully on the new environment.
